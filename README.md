# UnEscaped
UnEscaped is a simple command line tool written in C to well, unescape shit yk. I was annoyed doing console.log(unescape('string')) on skid sites to see what they were hiding, so I made a simple tool to do it for me :3

# How to build
Simple, Just use the Gnu C Compiler, or GCC. Just simply run `gcc unescape.c`!

# How to use (you will have a different filename, unles you do -o in GCC)
## Linux
`./Unescaped file.txt` 
## Windows
`cd unescaped`<br>
`unescaped.exe file.txt`
## Both
Just drag your text file over the application
